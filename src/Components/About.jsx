            I am an aspiring web developer working on mostly personal projects.
            I am no longer seeking a Front End Web Developer position, as I am
            back on the AS400! I have experience in full stack web development
            using technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, PHP,
            Bootstrap, React Bootstrap, Tailwind, Flowbite-React, Bulma, Git,
            Heroku, MongoDB, PostgreSQL and jQuery. In my spare time, I enjoy
            painting murals, making cold process soap and hanging out with my
            mini Aussie, Nina. Please take a look at some of my personal
            websites below!
